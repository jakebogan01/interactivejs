# Learn JavaScript Visually

This is a website that is inspired heavily by [`W3schools`](https://www.w3schools.com). The goal is to refine (for now) JavaScript Array methods, but in a visual and interactive way. More suitable to beginners trying to wrap their heads around JavaScript or even for those who just need a refresher. Depending on the success of this project, more topics can then be covered.
